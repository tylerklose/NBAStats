# Testing

## Gauge

### Why Gauge?
I have experience working with `rspec`, but I wanted to use this greenfield development project as an opportunity to explore a new testing framework. Gauge is a framework that has recently come up on our radar at work. It is BDD-like in the sense that it is English readable and it tries to sell a story of maintainability. No better way to find out than experimenting with it!

### Step up
```console
brew install gauge
gauge install ruby
gauge init ruby
gauge run specs
```
