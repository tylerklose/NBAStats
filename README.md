# NBAStats
A Ruby wrapper around the completely undocumented stats.nba.com API

Based on internet consensus, the NBA allows developers to retrieve data from their APIs, but they provide zero hand-holding (aka there is no known documentation on how to use the API). I hope to create a wrapper that is both easy to use and heavily documented (to make it even easier to use). For the time being, I will continue to poke around and see what kind of progress I can make by starting off small and gradually adding on more and more capabilities.

More. will. come.
